										<style> h2{text-align: left;} </style>
										<p>The story of the program is that you're a realtor for a property management company in Isla Vista and need the program to 
											sort through apartments. The ptrogram takes in apartment objects which contain the information of their rent, distance from 
											campus, and their condition. The program allows you to compare apartments to one another to see which is better, get affordable
											apartments in your budget, and implements the mergesort algorithm to rank them based on the three parameters.

											<h3 class="major">Goat Management System</h3>
											<p>This program acts like a database that in this case organizes goats. The program takes in a text file that contains
												a goat's name, age, and color. After the program reads the file you can use the menu to change a variety of things 
												about each goat's information in the file. By selecting a number that correlates to an action, it will allow you to make a change
												to that specific goat in the database, but not the text file.

											<h3 class="major">State Capitals Knowledge Game</h3>
											<p>This game tests your knowledge of your states and related capitals. The program uses a text file that contains each capital city, state, and state abreviation. 
												The program will then ask the user 10 questions to which they will have to answer with the city name or the state name/abbreviation.
												After the user has completed the quiz, the program will return the percentage of correct answers.

											<h3 class="major">Password Generator</h3>
											<p>This program generates a password for the user using the inputs that the user is prompted to answer. Depending on what the user inputs
												will determine how many letters and numbers the password will contain, as well as if it will require any additional special characters. 
												From this information the user provides the program will then return a password that meets all the criteria the user input.
